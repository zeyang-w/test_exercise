GitHub test exercise
====================

This is a trivial exercise to get you started with Git and GitHub. All you
need to do is edit `exercise.txt` to replace `Hello World` with `Hello Mars!`
Don't forget the exclamation mark.

Once you've made your changes and saved them, you just need to commit and push,
and then head back to your repository page on GitHub to check if you've passed
the test.

A detailed description of how to do this exercise is provided on `the FoNS
Git documentation page
<https://imperial-fons-computing.github.io/3_git.html#doing-coursework-using-github-classroom>`_.
